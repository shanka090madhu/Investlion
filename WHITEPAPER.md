## 1. Introduction

InvestLion is a utility-first crypto project built on BNB Smart Chain (BSC).
The project focuses on transparency, real platform utility, and long-term ecosystem growth rather than short-term hype or speculation.

ILION is not designed as a meme token or a high-risk speculative asset.
It is a platform utility token intended to support access, participation, and rewards within the InvestLion ecosystem.

## 3. InvestLion Solution

InvestLion is designed to address these issues by prioritizing:

- Utility before price
