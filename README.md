- Utility before price  
- Long-term thinking  
- Responsible token management

## ILION Token Utility (Planned)

ILION is designed as a platform utility token, not a speculative asset.

Planned use cases include:
- Platform access and membership tiers  
- Internal rewards and incentives  
- Referral participation and bonuses  
- Early access to features and updates

## Transparency Notice

ILION currently has very low public liquidity.
Any displayed token price or wallet valuation does not represent real market value at this stage.

The project is in a build and utility phase, not a trading or price speculation phase.
Any actions that affect token supply or ecosystem structure will be communicated publicly in advance.
